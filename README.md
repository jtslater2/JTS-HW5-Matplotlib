# JTS-HW5-Matplotlib

One of the most important aspects of data science is presenting the data in an easily understood graphical format.  The Matplotlib library in Python allows the user to create graphs, bar charts, pie charts and box plots from data with great flexibility.  Our homework assignment asked us to take the results of a 10 drug programs and use matplotlib to graphically represent some of the outcomes.   The first step was to clean the data and combine the two separate data files into a single dataframe.  The next step was to create a statistics table for the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and sem of the total tumor volume of tumors for each drug.  Using matplotlib, we began making bar charts and pie charts representing data points and the breakdown of male and female mice for the study.  The quartiles were calculated for 4 different drugs based on the final tumor volume and those results were captured on a single box plot.  A line chart was created for the tumor volume vs timepoint for a single mouse on the Capomulin drug.  Finally, a scatter plot was created using the average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the drug Capomulin with the correlation coefficient and the linear regression applied to the data as well.
